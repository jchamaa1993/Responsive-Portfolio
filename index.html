				<p class="aboutMeText">	My full name is Judd Nader Chamaa. I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on March 30, 1993 to two immigrant parents from Syria. I moved to Orange County, California at the age of six with my two parents and younger brother, and have called it my home ever since. I received my B.S. in Civil Engineering and my M.S. in Structural Earthquake Engineering from the University of California Los Angeles in 2015 and 2016, respectively. I now reside in Marina Del Rey and work for DPR, a general contractor, as a Project Engineer.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="aboutMeText">
				My hobbies include sports, coding, and hanging out with friends. My favorite activity is playing basketball. My family means the world to me. My philosophy in my life is to always push yourself to learn and be the best person you can be.</p>
